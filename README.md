# car-dealership
I used the MERN-stack to create a car dealership website

#navigate to the car-dealership folder on your terminal and
type npm install, to install node_modules, cd into the client folder and do the same.

#create folder called config in the car-dealership folder then inside a file called default.json e.g ("config>defualt.json file"). inside the defualt.json file enter your MONGODB_URL to connect to your mongodb

#then type npm run dev on your terminal for both the server and client side to start the app
